### Hello there, I am Jeronim MatijeviÄ‡
I'm a Graduate student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Zagreb currently enrolled in the Computer Science MSc programme. Passionate about neural networks for all purposes.

Generally I find models linking the gap between natural language processing and computer vision fascinating. 

MLOps is also something i find very interesting

* * *


### Fields of interest

* computer vision in general
* generative models
* neural radiance fields
* depth estimation

* * *

### CV
I created this website because all the projects listed in my CV were bloating it too much, and I felt that people would skip over it without reading anything.

### My projects:
I have divided my projects into ones i have done during for my education and ones i have done in my free time

* [Some of my hobby projects](./hobby_projects.html).

* [Short overview of my Deep Learning university projects](./university_projects.html).

### Interesting computer vision material:

### Life Goals:
- Make it through my entire life without ever making a linkedin profile
- To own a small boat
- Make this website with the aesthetic such as these:
  - [Vaisko](https://www.vaisko.com)
  - [smile.rip](https://smile.rip/)




There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.


# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

*   This is an unordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `oreos`      | hmm   |
| ok           | good `zoute` drop | yumm  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:



- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
