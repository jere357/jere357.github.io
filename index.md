### Bio
Hello there, I am Jeronim MatjieviÄ‡ and I'm a Graduate student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Zagreb currently enrolled in the Computer Science MSc programme. Passionate about neural networks for all purposes, with years of experience in training models for various tasks. Generally I find models linking the gap between natural language processing and computer vision fascinating. MLOps is also something i find very interesting

* * *


### Fields of interest:

* computer vision in general
* generative models
* neural radiance fields
* depth estimation

* * *

### CV:
The reason why i created this website was that I felt like all the projects I have listed in my cv bloat it too much and people would just skip it all and not read anything

[CV link](./Jeronim_Matijevic_cv.pdf)

### My projects:
I have divided my projects into ones i have done during for my education and ones i have done in my free time

* [Some of my hobby projects](./hobby_projects.html).

* [Short overview of my Deep Learning university projects](./university_projects.html).

### Life Goals:
- Make it through my entire life without ever making a linkedin profile
- To own a small boat
- Make this website with the aesthetic such as these:
  - [Vaisko](https://www.vaisko.com)
  - [simle.rip](https://smile.rip/)




There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.


# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:



- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
