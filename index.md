# Hello there, I am Jeronim Matijević
I'm a Graduate student at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing. Currently enrolled in the Computer Science MSc programme. Passionate about neural networks for all purposes.

The reason why I created this website is because all the projects listed in my CV were bloating it too much, and I felt that people would skip over it without reading anything. + ngl i always wanted to have a tumblr so i guess this is something like it

Generally I find models bridging the gap between natural language processing and computer vision fascinating. I think CLIP embeddings will become a part of every state-of-the-art computer vision model in the future

MLOps is also something I find very interesting.

## Fields of interest

* Computer vision
* Generative models
* Neural radiance fields
* Depth estimation

# My projects
I have divided my projects into ones i have done during for my education and ones i have done in my free time + things i want to research

1. [Some of my still unfinished research](./research.html)

2. [Some of my hobby projects](./hobby_projects.html).

3. [Short overview of my Deep Learning university projects](./university_projects.html).
