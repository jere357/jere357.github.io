## Hello there, I am Jeronim Matijević
I'm a Graduate student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Zagreb currently enrolled in the Computer Science MSc programme. Passionate about neural networks for all purposes.

The reason why I created this webiste is because all the projects listed in my CV were bloating it too much, and I felt that people would skip over it without reading anything. + ngl i always wanted to have a tumblr so i guess this is something like it

Generally I find models linking the gap between natural language processing and computer vision fascinating. 

MLOps is also something I find very interesting.

### Fields of interest

* Computer vision
* Generative models (mostly GANs)
* Neural radiance fields
* Depth estimation

### My projects
I have divided my projects into ones i have done during for my education and ones i have done in my free time

* [Some of my finished and still unfinished research](./research.html)

* [Some of my hobby projects](./hobby_projects.html).

* [Short overview of my Deep Learning university projects](./university_projects.html).
