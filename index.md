# Hello there, I am Jeronim Matijević

I am currently working as a research engineer at [tensorpix.](https://tensorpix.ai/) We are developing models for video superresolution and video restoration.

# Slides 
I sometimes talk about ML papers. If i told you you can find the slides on my site, here they are. Most of these, but not all are from our paperclub
