<h1 id="generating-livaja-with-a-champions-league-trophy-using-dreambooth">Generating Livaja with a champion’s league trophy using dreambooth.</h1>

<p>Another 2nd place finish in the national league, maybe it was time to replace the coach. I just wanted to see my favorite player holding the champions league trophy.

This project started as an idea to see wether it was possible to finetune a stable diffusion model so it could generate Marko Livaja holding the champions league trophy.</p>

<p>First i wanted to see what does stable diffusion know about SOCCER players, football players would be generated as american football players indicating a regional bias in the annotations. And whether it knows what the UEFA champion’s league trophy looks like. Also there was the question of which baseline model should i finetune, compvis1.4, runway1.5 or the stability2.1</p>

<p>These results were okay enough to start my dreambooth journey. What i wanted to do was a bit different from the usual dreambooth subject/class pairing since the model doenst know what the UCL trophy looks like. Can the model learn both Marko Livaja and the UCL trophy, and how?</p>

<h2 id="most-important-part-of-ml-the-data">Most important part of ML: The data</h2>

<p>I went on a mission to create a dataset of ~250 images containing player holding the trophy. The usual dreambooth dataset for generating people needs ~20 instance images of the person and 10x class images. After gathering the data. I have 24 images of Marko Livaja (all wearing the same home jersey) and 242 images of various players holding the UCL trophy.</p>

<h1 id="one-weird-prompt-trick">One weird prompt trick</h1>

<p>First i ran some experiments with the usual dreambooth prompt pairings: “a photo of a sks soccer player” and “a photo of a soccer player”, but the results were not good enough. I wanted to see if i could use the class prompt to my advantage. The new class prompt was “a soccer player holding a trophy”.</p>

<h1 id="which-baseline">Which baseline</h1>

<p>I had to choose on of the 3 baseline models, so i ran 3 experiments with different models to see how they behave after dreambooth tuning. The results were not that different, but i like the stabilityai results the most.</p>
